Here are a few tips for rspec that I have collected.

* use the let block
* avoid explict subject
* use factory girl or some other object factory
* keep your tests fast with judicius mocking
* use a second test suit for integration tests
* use contexts and describe blocks liberally
* one expectation per it block
